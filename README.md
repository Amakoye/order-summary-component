## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used most of the concepts I used while doing the product preview card component. I didn't struggle much coz the layout is quite simple, and does not change on small devices. I utilized the flex box to layout the page as designed.

### Continued development

I did struggle with making the shadow effect on the button. I did not bring it out as close to the one in design. I'll be looking forward to refining that to be as close to perfect as possible. Comments on how I can achieve this are welcomed and shall be highly appreciated. Thanks.
